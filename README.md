# Flutter App Star Wars

Flutter App developed with MobX, Flutter Modular and Dio <br>{<br>
  On the first screen we have a list of all the Star Wars characters.<br>
  We can access any character to access the details of that character and see a list of the films he participated in.<br>
  We can also access any of these films to see some details about it, such as, director, release date, producers, and the name.<br>
}<br>
<br>
##If you are going to use the code:
Currently the app makes all 9 requests to the characters API at once, which can impact the performance of the app.<br>
If you want to change this, I recommend using a lib called Lazy_Load_ScrollView that will make the next list of characters only load after the user swipes down.<br>
